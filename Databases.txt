1.Presenting each of the RDBMS and their functionalities:

-MySQL:
MySQL happens to be one of the most popular databases, according to DB Engines Ranking. It’s a definite leader among SQL 
solutions, used by Google, LinkedIn, Amazon, Netflix, Twitter, and others. MySQL popularity has been growing a lot because 
teams increasingly prefer open-source solutions instead of commercial ones.

-PostgreSQL:
A tried-and-proven relational database that is known for supporting a lot of data types, intuitive storage of schemaless data, 
and rich functionality. Some developers go even as far as to claim that it’s the most advanced open-source database on 
the market. We wouldn’t go that far, but it’s definitely a highly universal solution.

-SQL Server:
Unlike Postgresql vs MySQL, SQL Server is a commercial solution. It’s preferred by companies who are dealing with large traffic 
workloads on a regular basis. It’s also considered to be one of the most compatible systems with Windows services.

                                              *****************************

2.A comparison between the three RDBMS:

-JSON Support:
all three solutions are pretty universal and offer a lot of functionality for non-standard data types. MySQL, however, 
puts multiple limitations for JSON files, but other than that, it’s highly compatible with advanced data.

-Data Queries:
If your priority is to save computing resources and storage, choose flexible solutions: the choice will be between MySQL vs SQL
Server. However, if you prefer clear organization and long-term order, Postgre, with its isolated approach, might be a better fit.

-Defragmentation:
MySQL and SQL Server offer more of defragmentation methods that Postgresql does. They consume less CPU and provide more 
flexible settings.
